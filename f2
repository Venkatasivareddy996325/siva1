Here's a more detailed explanation:
Version Control:
Git helps track changes made to files over time, allowing developers to revert to previous versions, see the history of modifications, and collaborate effectively. 
Distributed:
Unlike centralized systems, Git allows each developer to have a complete copy of the project's history locally, enabling offline work and faster collaboration. 
Key Features:
Branching: Git allows for creating multiple independent branches, enabling developers to experiment with new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. 
Merging: Git facilitates merging branches, allowing developers to combine their work seamlessly. 
Staging: Git uses a staging area where developers can prepare changes before committing them to the repository. 
Commit: A commit is a snapshot of the project's state at a particular point in time, allowing developers to track changes and revert to previous versions.
